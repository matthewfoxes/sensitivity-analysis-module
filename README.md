# sensitivity-analysis-module
This Fortran module provides a local sensitivity analysis tool for functions evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations. It allows you to estimate the gradient and Hessian at a reference point x0 and to predict the function value at nearby points using a second-order Taylor expansion.
